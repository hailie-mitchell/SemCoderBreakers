If pos is odd, it reverses the list from the beginning to the second last element. If pos is even, it reverses the list from the beginning to the last element. \n\nTo find an input such that the function returns [6, 1], we need to find a list nums and a position pos such that reversing nums from the beginning to the second last element (if pos is odd) or the beginning to the last element (if pos is even) gives us [6, 1]. \n\nWe can try nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and pos = 1, which gives us [8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. If we reverse this list from the beginning to the second last element, we get [6, 7, 8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], which is not [6, 1]. \n\nSo, we try nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and pos = 0, which gives us [8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. If we reverse this list from the beginning to the last element, we get [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], which is [6, 1]. \n\nSo, the input we need is nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and pos = 0.\n[/THOUGHT]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operation_to_perform([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 0) == [6, 1]\n"], "28": ["You will be given a function and an output in the form function(??) == output.
