It performs the following operations:\n- It initializes an empty list called `index` to store the starting indices of occurrences of `sub` in `text`.\n- It uses a `while` loop that continues as long as `starting` is not `-1`.\n- Inside the loop, it uses `text.find(sub, starting)` to search for the substring `sub` in the `text` starting from the current `starting` index.\n- If a match is found, the starting index of that match is appended to the `index` list, and `starting` is updated to the end of the found substring (to search for the next occurrence).\n- If no match is found, `starting` becomes `-1`, and the loop terminates.\n- Finally, it returns the list of indices where `sub` was found in `text`.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function returns a list of indices where the substring `sub` appears in the string `text`.\n- If `sub` is not found in `text`, the function returns an empty list `[]`.\n- The function is case-sensitive, meaning that \"Hello\" and \"hello\" would be treated as different substrings.\n\n### Reverse Deduction\n- **Final output constraint**: The function is expected to return `[]`, which means that the substring `sub` must not be present in the string `text`.\n- **Input possibilities**: To achieve this, we can choose any string for `text` and any substring for `sub`.

It iterates over each number in `mos` and removes it from `nums` using `nums.pop(nums.index(num))`.\n2. After removing all elements from `mos`, it sorts `nums`.\n3.

For example, if we have `nums = [3, 2, 1]` and `mos = [1, 2, 3]`, the operations will remove all elements from `nums`, resulting in an empty list. After sorting, it will still be empty, and since there are no elements to compare, the function will return `True`.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the final list is not sorted. A simple case is to have `nums` as `[3, 2, 1]` and `mos` as `[1, 2, 3]`. This will lead to the following operations:\n1. Remove `1`, `2`, and `3` from `nums`, leaving it empty.\n2. Sort the empty list, which remains empty.\n3. Add `1`, `2`, and `3` back, resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`.\n4. The list is now `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted, so the function will return `True`.\n\nTo achieve the output `False`, we can use a different configuration. For example, if we set `nums = [1, 2, 3]` and `mos = [1, 2, 3]`, the operations will remove all elements, leaving `nums` empty, and then adding them back will still result in `[1, 2, 3]`, which is not sorted.\n\nThus, a valid input that leads to `False` is:\n[/MONOLOGUE]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operation_to_perform([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3]) == False\n"}

The width is calculated as `len(line) + i // len(char)`, where `i` is the current iteration index.\n4. Finally, it returns the modified `line`.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function modifies the string based on the number of occurrences of `char`.\n- The width of the centered string increases with each iteration, which means that the final output will be padded with `char`.\n- The output will be a string that is centered with the specified character.\n\n### Reverse Deduction\n- **Final output constraint**: The function returns `\"$$78$$\"`. This indicates that the string has been centered with the character `'$'`.\n- **Character count**: The string `\"$$78$$\"` contains two `'$'` characters, which means `char` must be `'$'`.\n- **Length of the input string**: The length of the input string must be such that when the function centers it, it results in `\"$$78$$\"`.\n- **Calculating the width**:\n  - The length of the output is `6`, which means the original string must have been centered to a width of `6`.\n  - The width calculation is `len(line) + i // len(char)`.\n  - If we assume `count` is `2` (since there are two `'$'` characters), then:\n    - For `i = 1`: `len(line) + 1 // 1 = 6`\n    - For `i = 0`: `len(line) + 0 // 1 = 6`\n  - This means the original string must have been `6` characters long.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo satisfy the output of `\"$$78$$\"`, we can deduce that the input string must be `\"78\"`, which has a length of `2`. The character `'$'` will be used to center it to the desired output.\n\nThus, the assertion would be:\n[/MONOLOGUE]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operation_to_perform(\"78\", '$') == \"$$78$$\"\n"}

For example, if we set `text` to `\"hello\"`, `suffix` to `\"abc\"`, and `num` to `123`, we can check:\n\n- `text = \"hello\"`\n- `suffix = \"abc\"`\n- `num = 123`\n\nThe concatenated string would be `\"abc123\"`, which is not a suffix of `\"hello\"`.\n\nThus, the assertion can be constructed as follows:\n[/MONOLOGUE]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operation_to_perform(\"hello\", \"abc\", 123) == False\n"}

Here's how it works:\n- It splits the input string into lines using the newline character (`\\n`).\n- It initializes an empty list `b` to store the processed lines.\n- It iterates over each line in the list `a`.\n- For each line, it replaces all occurrences of the tab character (`\\t`) with four spaces (`\"    \"`).\n- Finally, it joins the processed lines back together with newline characters and returns the resulting string.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The input string can contain multiple lines, and each line may contain tabs.\n- The output string will have all tabs replaced with four spaces.\n- The output format will maintain the original line breaks from the input.\n\n### Reverse Deduction\n- **Final output constraint**: The output is `\"            tab tab tabulates\"`, which indicates that the input must contain a line that, when processed, results in this exact string.\n- **Tabs to spaces conversion**: The output has four spaces before the word \"tabulates\". This means that the input must have had a tab character before the word \"tabulates\".\n- **Line structure**: The input must be structured such that when processed, the tab character is replaced with four spaces, resulting in the output.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo achieve the output `\"            tab tab tabulates\"`, we can create an input string that contains a tab character before \"tabulates\".

be:\n```\n\"\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\

If `spot` is out of bounds, it will still insert the value, but it may not be at the expected position.\n- The value `idx` can be any type of element that can be inserted into the list.\n\n### Reverse Deduction\n- **Final output constraint**: The function returns `[9, 1, 0, 1, 1]`.

Therefore, we need to determine the values of `spot` and `idx` such that after insertion, the list matches the output.\n- **Identifying `spot` and `idx`**:\n  - If we assume `spot` is `0`, then `idx` must be `9`, as `9` will be inserted at the beginning of the list.\n  - If we assume `spot` is `1`, then `idx` must be `1`, as `1` will be inserted at the second position.\n  - If we assume `spot` is `2`, then `idx` must be `0`, as `0` will be inserted at the third position.\n  - If we assume `spot` is `3`, then `idx` must be `1`, as `1` will be inserted at the fourth position.\n  - If we assume `spot` is `4`, then `idx` must be `1`, as `1` will be inserted at the fifth position.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo satisfy the output `[9, 1, 0, 1, 1]`, we can deduce that:\n- If we set `spot = 0` and `idx = 9`, the list will be `[9, 1, 0, 1, 1]` after insertion.\n\nThus, the assertion can be constructed as follows:\n[/MONOLOGUE]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operation_to_perform([1, 0, 1, 1], 0, 9) == [9, 1, 0, 1, 1]\n"}

It reverses the `array`.\n2. It iterates over each `value` in the `values` list and inserts it into the middle of the `array` using `array.insert(len(array) // 2, value)`.\n3. After inserting all values, it reverses the `array` again.\n4. Finally, it returns the modified `array`.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function modifies the `array` in place by reversing it and then inserting values at the middle index.\n- The final output is a list that is the result of reversing the modified array.\n- The length of the `array` before insertion is crucial because the middle index is calculated as `len(array) // 2`.\n\n### Reverse Deduction\n- **Final output constraint**: The function returns `[58, 92, 21]`. This means that after the operations, the array must contain these three values in that order.\n- **Reversal behavior**: Since the array is reversed before insertion and then reversed again, the original order of the input `array` must be such that when reversed, it results in `[58, 92, 21]`.\n- **Insertion behavior**: The values in `values` must be inserted at the middle index of the reversed array. If we denote the original array as `original_array`, the middle index before insertion is `len(original_array) // 2`.\n\nTo find a suitable input:\n1. The original array must be `[21, 92, 58]` because reversing it gives `[58, 92, 21]`.\n2. The values to insert must be such that when inserted into the middle of `[21, 92, 58]`, they maintain the order.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo satisfy the output of `[58, 92, 21]`, we can use the original array `[21, 92, 58]` and insert values that do not change the order when inserted at the middle. For example, we can insert `[10, 20]`, which will result in:\n- Insert `10` at index `1` (middle of `[21, 10, 92, 58]`).\n- Insert `20` at index `2` (middle of `[21, 10, 20, 92, 58]`).\n\nThus, the input for the function can be:\n```python\narray = [21, 92, 58]\nvalues = [10, 20]\n```\n\nThe correct assertion would be:\n[/MONOLOGUE]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operation_to_perform([21, 92, 58], [10, 20]) == [58, 92, 21]\n"}

It sorts the `txt` list.\n2. It checks if the index of `alpha` in the sorted list is even or odd:\n   - If the index is even, it returns the reversed sorted list.\n   - If the index is odd, it returns the sorted list as is.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The input list `txt` must contain at least one element that matches `alpha` for the function to work correctly.\n- The function relies on the index of `alpha` in the sorted list to determine the output.\n- The output will be the sorted list in reverse order if the index of `alpha` is even, otherwise it will be the sorted list in normal order.\n\n### Reverse Deduction\n- **Final output constraint**: The function returns `[\"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\"]`. This means that the sorted list must contain these elements.\n- **Index of `alpha`**: Since the output is in reverse order, we need to find an `alpha` such that its index in the sorted list is even.\n- **Finding `alpha`**:\n  - The sorted list `[\"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\"]` has the following indices:\n    - `\"2\"`: 0\n    - `\"3\"`: 1\n    - `\"4\"`: 2\n    - `\"7\"`: 3\n    - `\"8\"`: 4\n    - `\"9\"`: 5\n  - The index of `alpha` must be even (e.g., `\"2\"`, `\"4\"`, `\"8\"`).\n\n### Conclusion\nTo satisfy the output of `[\"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\"]`, we can choose `alpha` to be `\"2\"`, which has an index of 0 (even).\n\nThus, the input for the function can be:\n- `txt`: `[\"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\"]`\n- `alpha`: `\"2\"`\n\nThe assertion would be:\n[/MONOLOGUE]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operation_to_perform([\"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\"], \"2\") == [\"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\"]\n"}

It calculates `i` as the middle index of the string, which is `(len(text) + 1) // 2`.\n2. It initializes a list `result` with the characters of the input string.\n3. It enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `i` is less than the length of the string.\n4. Inside the loop:\n   - It converts the character at index `i` to lowercase.\n   - If the character at index `i` is already lowercase (i.e., it was already lowercase), it increments `i` by 1.\n   - If the character at index `i` is uppercase, it replaces the character at index `i` with its lowercase version and then increments `i` by 2.\n5. Finally, it returns the modified string by joining the list back into a string.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function modifies the string based on the case of characters at specific indices.\n- The index `i` starts from the middle of the string and moves forward.\n- The function will only modify characters that are uppercase, and it skips over characters that are already lowercase.\n- The output string will have the same length as the input string.\n\n### Reverse Deduction\n- **Final output constraint**: The output is `\"mJklbn\"`. This means that the characters at the specified indices must be transformed to produce this output.\n- **Character analysis**:\n  - The first character `m` is already lowercase, so it must have come from an uppercase character.\n  - The second character `J` is uppercase, so it must have been converted to lowercase.\n  - The third character `k` is already lowercase, so it must have come from an uppercase character.\n  - The fourth character `l` is already lowercase, so it must have come from an uppercase character.\n  - The fifth character `b` is already lowercase, so it must have come from an uppercase character.\n  - The sixth character `n` is already lowercase, so it must have come from an uppercase character.\n\n- **Finding the input**:\n  - To produce `m`, we need an uppercase `M`.\n  - To produce `J`, we need an uppercase `J`.\n  - To produce `k`, we need an uppercase `K`.\n  - To produce `l`, we need an uppercase `L`.\n  - To produce `b`, we need an uppercase `B`.\n  - To produce `n`, we need an uppercase `N`.\n\nThus, the input string that would lead to the output `\"mJklbn\"` is `\"MJKLBN\"`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe input that satisfies the output condition is `\"MJKLBN\"`.\n\nThe correct assertion would be:\n[/MONOLOGUE]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operation_to_perform(\"MJKLBN\") == \"mJklbn\"\n"}

Here's how it works:\n- It initializes `subs` with the same value as `strands`.\n- It iterates over each string in `subs` using its index.\n- For each string `j`, it performs a series of rotations (or \"shifts\") of characters.
