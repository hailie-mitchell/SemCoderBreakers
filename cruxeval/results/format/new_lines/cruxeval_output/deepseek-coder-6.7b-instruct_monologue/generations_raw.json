The function f is defined, which takes a single argument s.\n2. The function is called with the argument \"hi\", so within the function, s is initially \"hi\".\n3. Inside the function, s is concatenated with itself, so s becomes \"hihi\".\n4. The function then returns a new string that starts with \"b\", followed by the value of s (which is now \"hihi\"), and ends with \"a\".\n5.

The function is called with the arguments [\"8\", \"9\", \"7\", \"4\", \"3\", \"2\"] and \"9\", so txt is initially [\"8\", \"9\", \"7\", \"4\", \"3\", \"2\"].\n3. The txt is sorted, so txt becomes [\"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\"].\n4. The index of \"9\" in txt is 5.\n5. Since 5 is not divisible by 2, the function returns txt in reverse order.\n6. The return value of the function is therefore [\"9\", \"8\", \"7\", \"4\", \"3\", \"2\"].\n[/THOUGHT]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operation_to_perform([\"8\", \"9\", \"7\", \"4\", \"3\", \"2\"], \"9\") == [\"9\", \"8\", \"7\", \"4\", \"3\", \"2\"]\n"
