The function initializes an empty dictionary occ to store the occurrences of each character.\n4. The function iterates over each character ch in the input text.\n5. The function initializes a dictionary name with the mapping of characters to their corresponding replacement characters.\n6. The function uses the get method of the dictionary name to retrieve the replacement character for the current character ch.
