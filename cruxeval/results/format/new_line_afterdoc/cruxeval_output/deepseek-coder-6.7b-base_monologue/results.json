The function is called with the argument \"\\t\\t\\ttab tab tabulates\", so within the function, text is initially \"\\t\\t\\ttab tab tabulates\".\n43. The function splits the text into lines using the split method with the argument \"\\n\", which returns a list of lines.\n44. The function then creates an empty list b.\n45. The function then iterates over each line in the list returned by the split method.\n46. For each line, the function replaces all occurrences of \"\\t\" with \"    \" using the replace method.\n47. The function then appends the modified line to the list b.\n48. The function then joins the list b back into a string using the join method with the argument \"\\n\", which returns a string with newlines between each line.\n49. The function then returns the resulting string.\n50.
