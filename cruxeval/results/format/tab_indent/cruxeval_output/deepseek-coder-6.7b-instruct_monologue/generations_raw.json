The function operation_to_perform is defined, which takes two arguments: a list container and an element cron.\n2. The function is called with the arguments [2, 3, 4, 2, 5] and 2.\n3. Inside the function, it checks if cron is in container. In this case, cron is 2 and it is in container.\n4. It then finds the index of the first occurrence of cron in container.\n5. It splits container into two parts: the prefix (all elements before the first occurrence of cron) and the suffix (all elements after the first occurrence of cron).\n6. It returns the concatenation of the prefix and suffix.\n7.
