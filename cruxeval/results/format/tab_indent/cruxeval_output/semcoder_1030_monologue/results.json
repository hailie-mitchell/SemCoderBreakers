The transformations are based on the characters 'a', 'i', 'o', and 'e' being replaced by 'i', 'o', 'u', and 'a', respectively. The function uses the `str.translate` method along with a translation table created using `str.maketrans`.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function will continue to replace occurrences of 'a' and 'A' in the input string until there are no more occurrences of either character.\n- The function uses a specific mapping of characters: 'a' becomes 'i', 'A' becomes 'I', 'i' becomes 'o', and 'e' becomes 'a'.\n- The function returns the modified string after all possible replacements have been made.\n\n### Execution Simulation\nLet's simulate the execution of `operation_to_perform(\"biec\")` step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Input**: The input string is `\"biec\"`.\n2. **Line [L6]**: The translation table is created using `str.maketrans(\"aioe\", \"ioua\")`.

The translation occurs as follows:\n   - 'b' remains 'b' (not in the translation table).\n   - 'i' is replaced with 'o' (from the translation table).\n   - 'e' is replaced with 'a' (from the translation table).\n   - 'c' remains 'c' (not in the translation table).\n   After the translation, the new `input_string` becomes `\"boac\"`.\n5. **Line [L7]**: The loop checks again if 'a' or 'A' is in `\"boac\"`.
