This method returns a tuple containing:\n  - The part of the string before the last occurrence of `text[i]`.\n  - The last occurrence of `text[i]`.\n  - The part of the string after the last occurrence of `text[i]`.\n- The length of the part before the last occurrence is calculated and added to `s`.\n- Finally, the function returns the total sum `s`.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function counts the number of characters before the last occurrence of each character in the string.\n- The sum `s` is the cumulative length of these parts.\n- The input string must have at least one character to avoid division by zero when calculating the length.\n\n### Reverse Deduction\n- **Final output constraint**: The function returns `3`, which means that the cumulative length of the parts before the last occurrences of each character in the string must equal `3`.\n- **Character occurrences**: For each character `text[i]`, the length of the part before the last occurrence must be counted. If we denote the length of the string as `n`, then:\n  - The total length of all parts before the last occurrences must be `3`.\n- **Example breakdown**:\n  - If we consider a string like `\"aabb\"`, the last occurrences of `'a'` and `'b'` are at indices `2` and `3`, respectively.\n  - The lengths of the parts before these occurrences are:\n    - For `'a'`: `len(\"\") = 0` (before the first character)\n    - For `'a'`: `len(\"\") = 0` (before the second character)\n    - For `'b'`: `len(\"\") = 0` (before the first character)\n    - For `'b'`: `len(\"\") = 0` (before the second character)\n  - This results in a total of `0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0`, which does not satisfy the condition.\n  \n- If we consider the string `\"aa\"`, the last occurrences of `'a'` are at indices `1` and `2`.\n  - The lengths of the parts before these occurrences are:\n    - For `'a'`: `len(\"\") = 0` (before the first character)\n    - For `'a'`: `len(\"\") = 0` (before the second character)\n  - This results in a total of `0 + 0 = 0`, which does not satisfy the condition.\n\n- If we consider the string `\"ab\"`, the last occurrences of `'a'` and `'b'` are at indices `1` and `2`.\n  -
