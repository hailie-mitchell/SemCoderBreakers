It checks if the string `s` starts with the string `o`. If it does, it returns `s`. If not, it recursively calls itself with `s` and the reverse of the last two characters of `o`. The purpose of this function is to determine if the string `s` can be derived from `o` by appending characters from the end of `o` in reverse.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function uses recursion to explore different transformations of `s` based on the prefix `o`.\n- The recursion continues until `s` either matches `o` or cannot be derived from `o` by appending characters from the end of `o`.\n- The function assumes that `o` is at least 2 characters long since it reverses the last two characters of `o`.\n- The function will return the original string `s` if it matches the prefix `o`.\n\n### Execution Simulation\nLet's simulate the execution of `operation_to_perform(\"abba\", \"bab\")` step by step.\n1.

It performs a series of checks and operations on the `text` based on the values of `old` and `new`. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n- It first checks if the length of `old` is greater than 3. If it is, the function returns the original `text`.\n- Next, it checks if `old` is present in `text` and if there are no spaces in `text`. If both conditions are met, it replaces `old` in `text` with `new` repeated for the length of `old`.\n- If the conditions are not met, it enters a `while` loop that continues to replace `old` with `new` until `old` is no longer found in `text`.\n- Finally, it returns the modified `text`.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function expects `text` to be a string, `old` and `new` to be strings as well.\n- If the length of `old` is greater than 3, the function will return the original `text` without any modifications.\n- The function handles cases where `old` is found in `text` and ensures that `new` is repeated according to the length of `old`.\n- The function will replace all occurrences of `old` in `text` until no more occurrences are found.\n\n### Execution Simulation\nLet's simulate the execution of `operation_to_perform(\"avacado\", \"va\", \"-\")` step by step.\n1. The function is called with `text = \"avacado\"`, `old = \"va\"`, and `new = \"-\"`.\n2. [L6]: The length of `old` (\"va\") is checked. It is 2, which is not greater than 3, so we proceed.\n3. [L8]: The condition `old in text` checks if \"va\" is in \"avacado\". This is `True`, and the next condition checks if there are no spaces in `text`. Since \"avacado\" contains spaces, this condition is also `False`.\n4. Since both conditions are `False`, we skip the replacement operation in [L10].\n5. [L11]: The `while` loop checks if `old` (\"va\") is still in `text`. It is, so we enter the loop.\n   - [L12]: Inside the loop, we replace \"va\" with \"-\" in `text`. The new value of `text` becomes \"a-cado\".\n6. The loop continues to check if \"va\" is still in \"a-cado\". It is, so we replace it again. The new value of `text` becomes \"a--cado\".\n7.

The function works as follows:\n- It initializes a counter `i` to 0.\n- It enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `i` is less than the length of the string and the character at index `i` is a whitespace character (using `text[i].isspace()`).\n- Inside the loop, it increments `i` by 1 for each whitespace character found.\n- After exiting the loop, it checks if `i` is equal to the length of the string. If it is, it means the entire string consists of whitespace, and the function returns the string \"space\".\n- If `i` is not equal to the length of the string, it returns \"no\", indicating that there are non-whitespace characters present.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function expects a string input.\n- It checks for whitespace characters only; any other characters will cause it to return \"no\".\n- If the string is empty or consists solely of whitespace, it will return \"space\".\n- The function does not modify the input string; it only reads from it.\n\n### Execution Simulation\nLet's simulate the execution of `operation_to_perform(\"     \")` step by step.\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `i` is initialized to `0`.\n\n2. **While Loop Execution**:\n   - The condition `i < len(text) and text[i].isspace()` is checked.\n   - Since `i` is `0`, `text[i]` is `' '` (a space), which is a whitespace character.\n   - The loop increments `i` to `1`.\n   - The condition is checked again.

The operation involves rotating the characters of each string to the right by one position. Specifically:\n- It initializes `subs` as a copy of `strands`.\n- It iterates over each string in `subs`.\n- For each string, it rotates the characters by moving the last character to the front and the rest of the characters to the back.\n- Finally, it concatenates all the strings in `subs` and returns the result.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function operates on a list of strings, which can contain any characters.\n- The rotation is performed for each string in the list.\n- The rotation is performed `len(j) // 2` times, where `j` is the current string being processed.\n- The function returns a single string formed by concatenating all the strings in the list after the rotations.\n\n### Execution Simulation\nLet's simulate the execution of

`operation_to_perform` takes two parameters: `text` and `suffix`. It performs the following operations:\n- It initializes `output` with the value of `text`.\n- It enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `text` ends with the specified `suffix`.\n- Inside the loop, it removes the `suffix` from the end of `text` by slicing it off and assigns the result back to `text`.\n- Finally, it returns the `output`, which will be the modified `text` after all occurrences of the `suffix` have been removed.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function modifies `text` by continuously removing the `suffix` from its end until it no longer ends with it.\n- The `suffix` can be any string, and if it is not found at the end of `text`, the function will return the original `text`.\n- The function will return an empty string if `text` is entirely composed of the `suffix`.\n\n### Execution Simulation\nLet's simulate the execution of `operation_to_perform(\"!klcd!ma:ri\", \"!\")` step by step.\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `text` is `\"!klcd!ma:ri\"`.\n   - `output` is initialized to `\"!klcd!ma:ri\"`.\n\n2. **First Iteration**:\n   - The `while` loop checks if `text.endswith(suffix)`, which is `True` since `text` ends with `\"!\"`.\n   -
