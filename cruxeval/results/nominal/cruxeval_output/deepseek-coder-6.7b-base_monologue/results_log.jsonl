The function operation_to_perform is defined, which takes two arguments: text and width.\n2. The function is called with the arguments \"l\\nl\" and 2, so within the function, text is initially \"l\\nl\" and width is initially 2.\n3. The function splits the text into lines using the split method with the argument \"\\n\", so lines becomes [\"l\", \"l\"].\n4. The function then iterates over each line in lines, and for each line, it calls the center method with the argument width, which centers the line in a string of width characters. The result of this call is then concatenated with a newline character, and the result is stored in the variable result.\n5. After iterating over all lines, the function removes the very last empty line from the result using the slice notation [:-1].\n6. The function then returns the result.\n[/THOUGHT]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operation_to_perform(\"l\\nl\", 2) == \"l \\nl\"\n"}
