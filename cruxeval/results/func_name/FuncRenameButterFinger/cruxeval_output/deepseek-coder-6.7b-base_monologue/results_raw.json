The function is called with the arguments [1, 2, -1, 4] and 2, so within the function, array is initially [1, 2, -1, 4] and target is initially 2.\n3. The function initializes two variables: count and i. count is initially 0 and i is initially 1.\n4. The function then enters a for loop that iterates over the elements of the array, starting from the second element (index 1).\n5. For each element, the function checks if the element is greater than the previous element and less than or equal to the target. If this condition is true, the function increments count by i.\n6. If the element is less than or equal to the previous element, the function sets i to 1.\n7. If the element is greater than the previous element, the function increments i by 1.\n8.

Inside the function, a new dictionary r is created with two keys: \"c\" and \"d\".\n4.

The value of r[\"d\"] is set to a copy of d, so r[\"d\"] is also a new dictionary with the same key-value pairs as d.\n6. The function then returns a tuple containing two values:\n   - The first value is a boolean that is True if r[\"c\"] and r[\"d\"] are the same object (i.e., if they refer to the same dictionary), and False otherwise.\n   - The second value is a boolean that is True if r[\"c\"] and r[\"d\"] have the same key-value pairs (i.e., if they are the same dictionary), and False otherwise.\n7.
