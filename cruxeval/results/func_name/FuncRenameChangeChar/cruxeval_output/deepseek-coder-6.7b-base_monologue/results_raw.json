The function opeRatiOn_to_pErfOrm is defined, which takes two arguments: nums and target.\n2. The function is called with the arguments [1, 2, 3] and 4, so within the function, nums is initially [1, 2, 3] and target is 4.\n3. The function iterates through each element in nums, and for each element n1, it iterates through each element in nums again, and for each element n2, it checks if n1 + n2 is equal to target.\n4. For the first iteration, n1 is 1 and n2 is 1, so n1 + n2 is 2, which is not equal to target (4).\n5. For the second iteration, n1 is 1 and n2 is 2, so n1 + n2 is 3, which is not equal to target (4).\n6. For the third iteration, n1 is 1 and n2 is 3, so n1 + n2 is 4, which is equal to target (4).\n7. For the fourth iteration, n1 is 2 and n2 is 1, so n1 + n2 is 3, which is not equal to target (4).\n8. For the fifth iteration, n1 is 2 and n2 is 2, so n1 + n2 is 4, which is equal to target (4).\n9. For the sixth iteration, n1 is 2 and n2 is 3, so n1 + n2 is 5, which is not equal to target (4).\n10. For the seventh iteration, n1 is 3 and n2 is 1, so n1 + n2 is 4, which is equal to target (4).\n11.
