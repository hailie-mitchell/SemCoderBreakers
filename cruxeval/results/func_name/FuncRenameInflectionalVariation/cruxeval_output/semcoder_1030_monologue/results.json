Here's how it works:\n- It enters a `while` loop that continues as long as the length of the list `s` is greater than 1.\n- Inside the loop, it clears the contents of the list `s` using `s.clear()`.\n- It then appends the length of the list `s` to itself using `s.append(len(s))`.\n- Finally, it returns the last element of the list `s` after the loop completes using `s.pop()`.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The input `s` is expected to be a list.\n- The loop will continue until the list has one or no elements.\n- The function modifies the list `s` by clearing it and appending its length repeatedly.\n- The function will return the last element of the list after the loop completes.\n\n### Execution Simulation\nLet's simulate the execution of `operation_to_performing([6, 1, 2, 3])` step by step.\n\n1. **Initial State**: The input list `s` is `[6, 1, 2, 3]`.\n2. **[L6]**: The `while` loop checks the condition `len(s) > 1`.
