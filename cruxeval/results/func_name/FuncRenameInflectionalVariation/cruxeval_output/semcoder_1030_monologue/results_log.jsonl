It returns a list of indices where the substring starts in the string. The function works as follows:\n- It initializes an empty list `index` to store the starting indices of the substring.\n- It sets a variable `starting` to `0`, which will be used to keep track of where to start searching for the substring in the text.\n- A `while` loop continues as long as `starting` is not `-1`.\n- Inside the loop, it uses the `find` method to search for the substring starting from the current `starting` index.\n- If a match is found, the index of the match is appended to `index`, and `starting` is updated to the end of the found substring (to search for the next occurrence).\n- Finally, the function returns the list of indices.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function expects `text` to be a string and `sub` to be a substring.\n- If the substring is not found in the text, the function will return an empty list.\n- The function uses the `find` method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring or `-1` if not found.\n- The function continues searching for occurrences until no more occurrences are found.\n\n### Execution Simulation\nLet's simulate the execution of `operation_to_performing(\"egmdartoa\", \"good\")` step by step.\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `index` is initialized to `[]`.\n   - `starting` is initialized to `0`.\n\n2. **First Iteration of the While Loop**:\n   - The condition `starting != -1` is `True` (since `starting` is `0`).\n   - The function calls `text.find(sub, starting)`, which searches for the substring \"good\" starting from index `0`.\n   - The substring \"good\" is not found in \"egmdartoa\", so `starting` is updated to `-1`.\n\n3. **End of While Loop**:\n   - The condition `starting != -1` is now `False`, so the loop ends.\n\n4. **Return Statement**:\n   - The function returns the `index`, which remains empty `[]` since no occurrences of \"good\" were found in \"egmdartoa\".\n\n### Conclusion\nThe function returns an empty list `[]` because the substring \"good\" does not exist in the string \"egmdartoa\".\n\nTherefore, the correct assertion would be:\n[/MONOLOGUE]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operation_to_performing(\"egmdartoa\", \"good\") == []\n"}

The `for` loop starts, iterating over the indices of the string.\n   - **Iteration 0** (`i = 0`):\n     - The character at index `0` is `'j'`, which is lowercase.\n     - The condition `text[i] == text[i].upper()` is `False` (since `'j'` is not uppercase).\n   - **Iteration 1** (`i = 1`):\n     - The character at index `1` is `'h'`, which is lowercase.\n     - The condition `text[i] == text[i].upper()` is `False` (since `'h'` is not uppercase).\n   - **Iteration 2** (`i = 2`):\n     - The character at index `2` is `'5'`, which is not a letter.\n     - The condition `text[i] == text[i].upper()` is `False` (since `'5'` is not uppercase).\n   - **Iteration 3** (`i = 3`):\n     - The character at index `3` is `'4'`, which is not a letter.\n     - The condition `text[i] == text[i].upper()` is `False` (since `'4'` is not uppercase).\n   - **Iteration 4** (`i = 4`):\n     - The character at index `4` is `'k'`, which is lowercase.\n     - The condition `text[i] == text[i].upper()` is `False` (since `'k'` is not uppercase).\n   - **Iteration 5** (`i = 5`):\n     - The character at index `5` is `'k'`, which is lowercase.\n     - The condition `text[i] == text[i].upper()` is `False` (since `'k'` is not uppercase).\n   - **Iteration 6** (`i = 6`):\n     - The character at index `6` is `'k'`, which is lowercase.\n     - The condition `text[i] == text[i].upper()` is `False` (since `'k'` is not uppercase).\n   - **Iteration 7** (`i = 7`):\n     - The character at index `7` is `'6'`, which is not a letter.\n     - The condition `text[i] == text[i].upper()` is `False` (since `'6'` is not uppercase).\n\nAfter checking all characters, no uppercase character was found that was preceded by a lowercase character.\n\n3. Since no uppercase character was found, the function reaches the return statement at [L9] and returns `False`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe function returns `False` for the input string `\"jh54kkk6\"`, as there are no uppercase letters that are preceded by lowercase letters.\n\nTherefore, the correct assertion would be:\n[/MONOLOGUE]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operation_to_performing(\"jh54kkk6\") == False\n"}

Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n- It calculates the length of the input list `nums` and stores it in the variable `count`.\n- It then creates a new list comprehension that iterates over a range of `count`, applying the modulo operation to each index `i`. The result is a list of `i % 2`, which will be either `0` or `1`.\n- The function then iterates over this list, appending the element at index `i` of the original list `nums` to itself.\n- Finally, it returns the modified list `nums`.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The input list can contain any integers, including negative numbers.\n- The function modifies the list in place by appending elements to it.\n- The length of the list is used to determine how many times the loop will iterate, which means the function will append elements based on the even or odd indices of the original list.\n\n### Execution Simulation\nLet's simulate the execution of `operation_to_performing([-1, 0, 0, 1, 1])` step by step.\n\n1. **Initialization**: The input list is `[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.\n2. **Count Calculation**: The length of `nums` is calculated:\n   - `count = len(nums)` results in `count = 5`.\n3. **List Comprehension**: The list comprehension `[i % 2 for i in range(count)]` generates the list `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0]`.
