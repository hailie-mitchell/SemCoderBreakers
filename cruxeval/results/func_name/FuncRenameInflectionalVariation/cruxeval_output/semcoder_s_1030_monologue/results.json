Specifically, it replaces lowercase 'a' with 'i', 'i' with 'o', 'o' with 'u', and 'e' with 'a'. If the input string contains uppercase 'A', it will also be replaced with 'I'. The function continues to perform these replacements until there are no more occurrences of 'a' or 'A' in the string.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function operates on strings and modifies them based on the defined character replacements.\n- The function uses a translation table created using `str.maketrans`, which maps specific characters to their corresponding replacements.\n- The function will return the modified string after all possible replacements have been made.\n- The function will only replace lowercase 'a' and uppercase 'A', and it will stop replacing once there are no more occurrences of these characters.\n\n### Execution Simulation\nLet's simulate the execution of `operation_to_performing(\"biec\")` step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Input**: The input string is `\"biec\"`.\n2. **Line [L6]**: The translation table is created using `str.maketrans(\"aioe\", \"ioua\")`. This maps:\n   - 'a' to 'i'\n   - 'i' to 'o'\n   - 'o' to 'u'\n   - 'e' to 'a'\n   The resulting translation table is `{97: 105, 105: 111, 111: 117, 101: 97}`.\n3. **Line [L7]**: The while loop checks if 'a' or 'A' is in the input string. The condition is `True` since both 'a' and 'A' are present in `\"biec\"`.\n4. **Line [L8]**: The `translate` method is called on the input string, applying the translation table. The string `\"biec\"` is transformed as follows:\n   - 'b' remains 'b'\n   - 'i' is replaced with 'o' \u2192 `\"boec\"`\n   - 'e' is replaced with 'a' \u2192 `\"boaec\"`\n   - 'c' remains 'c' \u2192 `\"boaec\"`\n5. **Line [L7]**: The loop checks again if 'a' or 'A' is in the updated string `\"boaec\"`. The condition is still `True`.\n6. **Line [L8]**: The `translate` method is called again, transforming the string:\n   - 'b' remains 'b'\n   - 'o' is replaced with 'u' \u2192 `\"buaec\"`\n   - 'a' is replaced with 'i' \u2192 `\"buiec\"`\n   - 'e' is replaced with 'a' \u2192 `\"buiaec\"`\n   - 'c' remains 'c' \u2192 `\"buiaec\"`\n7. **Line [L7]**: The loop checks again. The condition is still `True`.\n8. **Line [L8]**: The `translate` method is called again, transforming the string:\n   - 'b' remains 'b'\n   - 'u' is replaced with 'a' \u2192 `\"baiaec\"`\n   - 'i' is replaced with 'o' \u2192 `\"baoiaec\"`\n   - 'a' is replaced with 'i' \u2192 `\"baoiaec\"`\n   - 'e' is replaced with 'a' \u2192 `\"baoiaec\"`\n   - 'c' remains 'c' \u2192 `\"baoiaec\"`\n9. **Line [L7]**: The loop checks again.

The condition is still `True`.\n12. **Line [L8]**: The `translate` method is called again, transforming the string:\n    - 'b' remains 'b'\n    - 'i' is replaced with 'o' \u2192 `\"boiauaec\"`\n    - 'a' is replaced with 'i' \u2192 `\"boiauaec\"`\n    - 'o' is replaced with 'u' \u2192 `\"boiauaec\"`\n    - 'u' is replaced with 'a' \u2192 `\"boiauaec\"`\n    - 'a' is replaced with 'i' \u2192 `\"boiauaec\"`\n    - 'e' is replaced with 'a' \u2192 `\"boiauaec\"`\n    - 'c' remains 'c' \u2192 `\"boiauaec\"`\n13. **Line [L7]**: The loop checks again.
