The function is called with the arguments \"egmdartoa\" and \"good\", so within the function, text is initially \"egmdartoa\" and sub is initially \"good\".\n3. The function starts by initializing an empty list called index.\n4. The function then enters a while loop that continues as long as starting is not equal to -1.\n5. Inside the while loop, the function calls the find method of the text string with the sub argument as the search string and the starting argument as the starting index. The find method returns the index of the first occurrence of the sub string within the text string, or -1 if the sub string is not found.\n6. If the find method returns -1, the while loop ends and the function returns the value of index.\n7. If the find method returns a non-negative value, the index of the first occurrence of the sub string within the text string is added to the index list.\n8. The starting variable is then updated to be the index of the first occurrence of the sub string within the text string plus the length of the sub string.\n9.
