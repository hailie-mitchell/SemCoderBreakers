The purpose of this function is to remove all occurrences of the character `char` from the string `mess`, except for the last occurrence. Here's how it works:\n- It uses a `while` loop to repeatedly find the last occurrence of `char` in `mess` and remove it, starting from the next character after that occurrence.\n- The loop continues until there are no more occurrences of `char` left after the last one.\n- Finally, it returns the modified string `mess`.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function modifies the string `mess` in place, removing all instances of `char` except for the last one.\n- If `char` does not exist in `mess`, the function will return the original string unchanged.\n- The function uses `find` and `rindex`, which means it assumes that `char` is a single character.\n- The function does not handle cases where `mess` is empty or `char` is an empty string.\n\n### Execution Simulation\nLet's simulate the execution of `operationToPerform(\"0aabbaa0b\", \"a\")` step by step.\n\n1. **Initial State**: `mess = \"0aabbaa0b\"`, `char = \"a\"`.\n2. **First Iteration**:\n   - [L6]: The `while` loop checks if `mess.find(char, mess.rindex(char) + 1) != -1`.\n   - `mess.rindex(char)` returns the index of the last occurrence of `\"a\"`, which is `5`.\n   - `mess.find(char, 6)` checks for the next occurrence of `\"a\"` starting from index `6`.
