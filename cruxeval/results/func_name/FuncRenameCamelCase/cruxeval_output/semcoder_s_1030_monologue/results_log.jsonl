It returns a list of indices where the substring starts in the text. The function works as follows:\n- It initializes an empty list `index` to store the starting indices of the occurrences.\n- It uses a `while` loop that continues until it finds no more occurrences of the substring.\n- Inside the loop, it uses the `find` method to locate the substring starting from the current `starting` index.\n- If a match is found, the index is appended to the `index` list, and the `starting` index is updated to the end of the found substring.\n- Finally, the function returns the list of indices.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function will return an empty list if the substring is not found in the text.\n- The `find` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring, or `-1` if it is not found.\n- The function does not handle overlapping occurrences; it will only return the first occurrence of the substring.\n- The function is case-sensitive, meaning \"Good\" and \"good\" would be treated as different strings.\n\n### Execution Simulation\nLet's simulate the execution of `operationToPerform(\"egmdartoa\", \"good\")` step by step.\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `index` is initialized as an empty list: `index = []`.\n   - `starting` is initialized to `0`.\n\n2. **First Iteration**:\n   - The `while` loop checks if `starting` is not `-1`. Since `starting` is `0`, we proceed.\n   - `text.find(sub, starting)` is called, which searches for the substring \"good\" starting from index `0`.\n   - The substring \"good\" is not found in \"egmdartoa\", so `starting` is updated to `-1`.\n\n3. **Exit Loop**:\n   - The `while` loop checks again, and since `starting` is now `-1`, the loop exits.\n\n4. **Return Statement**:\n   - The function returns the `index` list, which remains empty because no occurrences of \"good\" were found.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe function returns an empty list `[]` because the substring \"good\" does not exist in the string \"egmdartoa\".\n\nTherefore, the correct assertion would be:\n[/MONOLOGUE]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operationToPerform(\"egmdartoa\", \"good\") == []\n"}
