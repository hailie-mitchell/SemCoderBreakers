The function operationToPerform is defined, which takes two arguments: an array and a number.\n2. The function is called with the arguments [1, 2] and 1, so within the function, array is initially [1, 2] and num is 1.\n3. The function checks if num is less than 0. Since num is 1, it is not less than 0, so reverse is False.\n4. The array is reversed, so array becomes [2, 1].\n5. The array is then multiplied by the absolute value of num, so array becomes [2, 1, 2, 1].\n6. The length of the array is calculated, so l is 4.\n7. Since reverse is False, the array is not reversed again.\n8. The function returns the array [2, 1, 2, 1].\n[/THOUGHT]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operationToPerform([1, 2], 1) == [2, 1, 2, 1]\n"}
