The function operation_to_perform is defined, which takes a single argument mo44.\n2. The function is called with the argument \"Manolo\", so within the function, mo44 is initially \"Manolo\".\n3. The lower() method is called on mo44, which converts all the characters in mo44 to lowercase. In this case, mo44 becomes \"manolo\".\n4. The first character of mo44 is extracted using indexing, and the rest of the string is extracted using slicing. In this case, head is \"m\" and tail is \"anolo\".\n5. The upper() method is called on head, which converts the first character to uppercase. In this case, head becomes \"M\".\n6. The concatenation of head and tail is performed, and the result is \"M\" + \"anolo\", which is \"Manolo\".\n7.
