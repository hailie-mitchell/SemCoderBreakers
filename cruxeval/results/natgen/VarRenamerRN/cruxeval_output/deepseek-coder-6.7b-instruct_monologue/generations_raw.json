The function operation_to_perform is defined, which takes two arguments n64 and alpha.\n2. The function is called with the arguments [\"8\", \"9\", \"7\", \"4\", \"3\", \"2\"] and \"9\", so within the function, n64 is initially [\"8\", \"9\", \"7\", \"4\", \"3\", \"2\"].\n3. The function sorts n64 in ascending order, so n64 becomes [\"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"7\", \"8\", \"9\"].\n4. The function then checks if the index of alpha in n64 is even. The index of \"9\" in n64 is 5, which is odd, so the function returns n64 reversed.\n5.
