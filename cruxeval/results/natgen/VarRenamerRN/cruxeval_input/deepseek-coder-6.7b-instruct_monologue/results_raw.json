Express your answer as a passing assertion containing the input and the given output.\n\n[PYTHON]\ndef f(x):\n    return x + 1\nassert f(??) == 17\n[/PYTHON]\n[THOUGHT]\nTo find an input such that executing f on the input leads to the given output, we can work backwards from the given assertion. We know that f(??) == 17. \n\nSince the function f(x) returns x + 1, for f(??) to be equal to 17, the value of ?? should be 16. \n[/THOUGHT]\n[ANSWER]\nassert f(16) == 17\n[/ANSWER]\n\n[PYTHON]\ndef operation_to_perform(F924):\n    middle = len(F924) // 2\n    return F924[middle:] + F924[0:middle]\n\nassert operation_to_perform(??) == [1, 1, 1]\n[/PYTHON]\n[THOUGHT]\nThe function operation_to_perform(F924) returns a list that has been rotated. To find the input such that the output is [1, 1, 1], we need to find the input that when passed to the function, returns [1, 1, 1]. \n\nThe function operation_to_perform(F924) rotates the list F924 by moving the middle element to the end of the list. If the length of the list is even, the middle is considered the right-hand side. \n\nSince the output is [1, 1, 1], the input should be a list with the same elements in the middle. \n\nSince we don't know the length of the list, we can try a few possibilities. A list of length 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. will all have the same middle element as the output. \n\nWe can start with a list of length 3, [1, 1, 1], and see if that's the input. \n[/THOUGHT]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operation_to_perform([1, 1, 1]) == [1, 1, 1]\n"], "596": ["You will be given a function and an output in the form function(??) == output.
