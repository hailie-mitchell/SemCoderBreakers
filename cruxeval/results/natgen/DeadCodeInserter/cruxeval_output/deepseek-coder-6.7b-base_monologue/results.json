The function operation_to_perform is defined, which takes two arguments: text and n.\n2. The function is called with the arguments \"bR\" and -1, so within the function, text is initially \"bR\" and n is initially -1.\n3. The first if statement checks if n is less than 0 or if the length of text is less than or equal to n. Since n is less than 0, the first if statement is true, so the function returns the value of text.\n4. The function then initializes a variable result to the empty string.\n5.
