The function operation_to_perform is defined, which takes two arguments: txt and alpha.\n2. The while loop is false, so it is skipped.\n3. The txt argument is sorted, resulting in ['2', '3', '4', '7', '8', '9'].\n4. The index of '9' in the sorted txt is 5, which is odd.\n5. So, the function returns the sorted txt in reverse order, which is ['9', '8', '7', '4', '3', '2'].\n[/THOUGHT]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operation_to_perform([\"8\", \"9\", \"7\", \"4\", \"3\", \"2\"], \"9\") == ['9', '8', '7', '4', '3', '2']\n"}
