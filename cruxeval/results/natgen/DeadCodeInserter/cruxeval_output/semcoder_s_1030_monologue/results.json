It appears to perform a series of operations on the list:\n1. It initializes a variable `_i_4` to `0`.\n2. It enters a `while` loop that continues as long as `_i_4` is less than `_i_4` itself. This means the loop will never execute because `_i_4` is always `0`.\n3. Inside the loop, the function reverses the `nums` list.\n4. After exiting the loop, it finds the maximum value in the list `nums` and stores it in `m`.\n5. It then enters a `for` loop that iterates `m` times. In each iteration, it reverses the `nums` list again.\n6. Finally, it returns the modified list `nums`.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function appears to be designed to reverse the list multiple times based on the maximum value of the list.\n- The input list can contain any integers, including duplicates.\n- The function does not modify the input list in a way that would change its length or values, as the reversal operation does not change the list's contents.\n- The function will always return the original list, as the reversal operation does not change the list's contents.\n\n### Execution Simulation\nLet's simulate the execution of `operation_to_perform([43, 0, 4, 77, 5, 2, 0, 9, 77])` step by step.\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `_i_4` is initialized to `0`.\n\n2. **While Loop**:\n   - The condition `_i_4 < _i_4` is checked. Since `_i_4` is `0`, this condition is `True`.\n   - The loop executes:\n     - The list `nums` is reversed. The list becomes `[77, 9, 0, 2, 5, 77, 4, 0, 43]`.\n   - The loop checks the condition again. Since `_i_4` is still `0`, it continues to reverse the list again.\n   - The list is reversed again, but since it is already reversed, it remains the same: `[77, 9, 0, 2, 5, 77, 4, 0, 43]`.\n   - The loop checks the condition again, and since `_i_4` is still `0`, it continues to reverse the list.\n   -
