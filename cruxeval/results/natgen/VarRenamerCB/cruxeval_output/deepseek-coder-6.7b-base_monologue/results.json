The function splits the text into lines using the split method, which returns a list of strings.\n53. The function then creates an empty list b.\n54. The function then iterates over the list of lines, and for each line, it replaces all occurrences of \"\\t\" with \"    \" (four spaces).\n55. The function then appends the modified line to the list b.\n56. The function then joins the list b back into a string using the join method, with \"\\n\" as the separator.\n57. The function then returns the resulting string.\n58.
