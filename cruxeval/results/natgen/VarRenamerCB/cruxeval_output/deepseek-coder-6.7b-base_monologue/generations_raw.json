The fourth character is \"o\", which does not match the given char \"r\", so the loop continues to the next character.\n7. The fifth character is \"r\", which matches the given char \"r\", so the index of that character is stored in length1.\n8. The for loop ends, and the value of length1 is 3.\n9.
