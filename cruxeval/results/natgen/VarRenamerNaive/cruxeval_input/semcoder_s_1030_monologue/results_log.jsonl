It performs the following operations:\n- It initializes an empty list called `index` to store the starting indices of occurrences of `sub` in `text`.\n- It initializes a variable `VAR_0` to `0`, which will be used to keep track of the current position in the string where the search for `sub` begins.\n- The `while` loop continues as long as `VAR_0` is not `-1`. Inside the loop:\n  - It calls `text.find(sub, VAR_0)` to find the first occurrence of `sub` starting from the current position `VAR_0`.\n  - If a match is found (i.e., `VAR_0` is not `-1`), it appends the starting index of that match to the `index` list and updates `VAR_0` to start searching after this match.\n- The loop continues until no more occurrences of `sub` are found.\n- Finally, it returns the list of indices where `sub` was found in `text`.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The function returns an empty list `[]` if `sub` is not found in `text`.\n- If `sub` is an empty string, it will always return `[]` because every position in `text` is a valid starting point for the empty substring.\n- If `text` is an empty string, the function will also return `[]`, as there are no occurrences of `sub`.\n\n### Reverse Deduction\n- **Final output constraint**: The function returns `[]`, which means that `sub` must not be present in `text`.\n- **Substring presence**: To ensure that `sub` is absent from `text`, we can either:\n  - Set `sub` to a string that does not exist in `text`.\n  - Set `text` to an empty string.\n  - Set `sub` to a non-empty string and ensure that `text` does not contain that substring.\n\n### Conclusion\nTo satisfy the condition that the function returns an empty list, we can choose:\n1. A `text` that is an empty string and a `sub` that is any non-empty string.\n2. A `text` that contains a substring that is not present in it, and `sub` can be any string.\n\nFor simplicity, we can choose:\n- `text = \"\"` (an empty string) and `sub = \"a\"` (a non-empty string).\n\nThus, the assertion would be:\n[/MONOLOGUE]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operation_to_perform(\"\", \"a\") == []\n"}

If `VAR_0` is a title (i.e., it starts with an uppercase letter and the rest are lowercase), it checks:\n   - If the length of `VAR_0` is greater than 1.\n   - If `VAR_0` is not fully lowercase (i.e., it has at least one uppercase letter).\n   - If both conditions are true, it returns the first character in lowercase followed by the rest of the string.\n2. If `VAR_0` is not a title but is composed entirely of alphabetic characters (checked by `VAR_0.isalpha()`), it returns the string with the first character capitalized.\n3.

Here's how it works:\n- It splits the input string into lines using the newline character (`\\n`) as a delimiter, resulting in a list of strings (`VAR_0`).\n- It initializes an empty list `b`.\n- It then iterates over each line in `VAR_0`, replacing each tab character (`\\t`) with four spaces (`\"    \"`).\n- Each modified line is appended to the list `b`.\n- Finally, it joins all the lines in `b` back together with newline characters and returns the resulting string.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The input string can contain multiple lines, and each line can have tabs that need to be replaced.\n- The output string will have the same number of lines as the input, but with all tabs replaced by four spaces.\n- The output formatting must match the expected output exactly.\n\n### Reverse Deduction\n- **Final output constraint**: The expected output is `\"            tab tab tabulates\"`. This indicates that the input must contain a line that, when processed, results in this exact string.\n- **Tabs to Spaces Conversion**: The output has 12 spaces before the word \"tabulates\". This means that the input must have had a tab character before the word \"tabulates\".\n- **Input Structure**: To achieve the output, the input string must have a line that looks like `\"\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\

It reverses the list `VAR_0`.\n3. It multiplies the reversed list by `num`.\n4. It calculates the length of the modified list `VAR_0`.\n5.

It performs a series of transformations on each string in the list:\n- It iterates over each string `j` in the list `VAR_0`.\n- For each string `j`, it performs a transformation by cycling the characters. Specifically, it rotates the characters in the string:\n  - The last character moves to the front.\n  - All other characters shift one position to the right.\n- This operation is performed `len(j) // 2` times.\n- Finally, it concatenates all the transformed strings into a single string and returns it.\n\n### Key Properties and Constraints\n- The input must be a list of strings.\n- The output string is formed by concatenating the transformed versions of the input strings.\n- The transformation is performed for each string in the list, and the number of transformations is determined by half the length of each string.\n\n### Reverse Deduction\n1. **Final output constraint**: The output is `\"__1.00r__j_a6__6\"`.

Start with the output string: `\"__1.00r__j_a6__6\"`.\n2. Reverse the transformations:\n   - The first character `_` remains `_`.\n   - The second character `_` remains `_`.\n   - The third character `1` becomes `1`.\n   - The fourth character `.` becomes `.`.\n   - The fifth character `0` becomes `0`.\n   - The sixth character `0` becomes `0`.\n   - The seventh character `r` becomes `r`.\n   - The eighth character `_` remains `_`.\n   - The ninth character `j` becomes `j`.\n   - The tenth character `a` becomes `a`.\n   - The eleventh character `6` becomes `6`.\n   - The twelfth character `_` remains `_`.\n   - The thirteenth character `6` becomes `6`.\n\nThus, the original strings that would lead to the output `\"__1.00r__j_a6__6\"` after transformations are `[\"__1.00r__j_a6__6\"]`.\n\nThe correct assertion would be:\n[/MONOLOGUE]\n[ANSWER]\nassert operation_to_perform([\"__1.00r__j_a6__6\"]) == \"__1.00r__j_a6__6\"\n"}
