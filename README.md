# SemCoderBreakers

Course project for the COMS_6998E Generative Models for Code course.
In the SemCoderBreakers project, we will perform an ablation study on the [SemCoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01006) model to explore how the novel training approach affects the robustness of the model.
Our robustness evaluation is based on and builds from [ReCode](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.10264).
